# Kubeflow

- Helps orchestrate machine learning training pipelines across on-prem and cloud-based resources.
- Can containerize training and serving infrastructure.

## Components
- Support for distributed TensorFlow training via the TFJob CRD
    - TFJob is a Kubernetes custom resource used to run TensorFlow training jobs on Kubernetes.
- The ability to serve trained models using TensorFlow Serving
    - Flexible, high performance serving system for machine learning models.
    - Installed by default when deploying Kubeflow.
- A JupyterHub installation with many commonly required libraries and widgets included in the notebook installation, included those needed for TensorFlow Model Analysis (TFMA) and TensorFlow Transform (TFT)
    - JupyterHub – Multi user server for Jupyter notebooks
    - TFMA – Library for evaluating TF models.
        - Uses Apache Beam
    - TFT – Preprocessing/feature engineering
        - Can prevent Training Serving Skew
            - Difference between performance during training and performance during serving. This can be caused by:
                - Discrepancy between how you handle data in the training and serving pipelines.
                - Change in the data between when you train and when you serve.
                - Feedback loop between model and algorithm.
        - Uses Apache Beam
- Kubeflow Pipelines
    - Has UI for managing and tracking experiments, jobs, and runs.
    - An engine for scheduling multi-step ML workflows
    - An SDK for defining and manipulating pipelines and components
    - Notebooks for interacting with the system using the SDK
